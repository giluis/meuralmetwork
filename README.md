A toy neural network to help people learn more about the topic

## Structure

### src

Contains the [src code](./src/README.md) in typescript.

--- 

### build
    
Contains the [compiled javascript code](./built). It is not a good pratice to commit this, but I figured it would help people understand the process of compilation to javascript better. idk
